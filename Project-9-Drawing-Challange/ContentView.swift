//
// Challange 1 - Create an Arrow shape â€“ having it point straight up is fine. This could be a
//  rectangle/triangle-style arrow, or perhaps three lines, or maybe something else depending on
//  what kind of arrow you want to draw.
// Challange 2 - Make the line thickness of your Arrow shape animatable.
// Challange 3 - Create a ColorCyclingRectangle shape that is the rectangular cousin of
//  ColorCyclingCircle, allowing us to control the position of the gradient using one or more
//  properties.
